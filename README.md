# Customer Churn Prediction using Deep Learning


This repository contains a deep learning project focused on predicting customer churn using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built with Keras and TensorFlow. The project leverages a customer churn dataset from Kaggle and aims to predict whether a customer will leave the company based on demographic and usage data.

# Project Overview

Customer churn prediction is crucial for retaining customers and minimizing revenue loss. This project uses deep learning techniques to accurately predict customer churn. The model is built using Keras and TensorFlow and includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

# Key Features:

1. Data Preprocessing:
* Handling missing data
* Encoding categorical variables
* Feature scaling (Standardization)

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
* Distribution plots for customer characteristics
* Correlation analysis to identify important features

3. Model Building:
* Constructed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using Keras
* Trained the ANN using the dataset
* Used ReLU activation for hidden layers and sigmoid for the output layer
* Optimized model with Adam optimizer
* Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle 

# Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:
* tensorflow
* keras
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
